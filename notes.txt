SCRAPER

Getting the mp3 file for a song is very hard.
Getting the number of how many times a song has been listened to is not easy, because that value is loaded with
Javascript on the song pages of Xiami.

The spider doesn't handle pagination at the moment so it might not get all 10000 songs we need, but it's good for
getting some data to work with. Implementing support for pagination is quite easy anyway.
